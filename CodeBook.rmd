# Created to supplement Kevin McCreery's submission for Getting and Cleaning Data, from Johns Hopkins Data Science Specialization  


##High-Level Description of the Data
The following variables are present in the output text file. Except for the subjectid and activityname variables, each variable is the mean of multiple observations for the same subjec and activity. The data were gathered using a Samsung Galaxy S II smartphone's gyroscope and accelerometer, and then various transformations were applied. Details for each variable are present in the following "Variables" section of the codebook.
